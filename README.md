# HYBROS-Kernel 
C++ x86/x86-64 kernel which loads other OS' like Windows or Linux and runs them simultaneously

Currently I'm adding some C++ std support and creating a heap memory manager 

Next steps:

1. Multiprocessor support

2. Read hard disks and scan for OS

3. Load kernels and hook memory functions etc.
